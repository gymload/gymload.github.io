			\ The notation "$SÃ—$R" means that the exercise is performed in $S sets, and in each set you do $R repetitions;
			\ a set is a series of movements performed consecutively without a long rest, so first you do $R reps,
			\ rest, then $R reps again, rest, and continue this way until you complete all $S sets.
