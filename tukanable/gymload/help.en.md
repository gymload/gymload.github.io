- **Progress Formula**:
  - Sigmoid - smooth weight increase with slowdown at the end

- **Barbell Weights** - specify barbell weights
- **Weight Plates** - list available plates

## Creating Exercises

### Adding an Exercise

1. Select a training day
2. Click the "Add Exercise" button
3. Fill in the parameters:
   - **Exercise name** - any custom name
   - **Weight type**:
     - Custom - you can set any weight and step
     - Dumbbells - weight will be rounded to available dumbbells
     - Barbell - weight will be calculated considering the bar and plates
   - **Sets** - number of sets
   - **Reps** - number of repetitions per set
   - **Begin Weight** - weight for the first week
   - **Finish Weight** - target weight for the last week
   - **Min Step** - for custom weight

### Automatic Weight Calculation

After filling in the parameters, the calculator automatically calculates weights for each week according to the selected progression formula. Weights are displayed below the exercise.

When using dumbbells or barbells, weights will be automatically rounded to what's available in the gym.

## Tracking Results

Switch to the day tab to record workout results:

1. Select the current week in the top tabs
2. Each exercise displays a set table
3. Cells show the recommended weight
4. You can enter actually performed repetitions in parentheses

## Statistics

The "Stats" section displays the total tonnage of all exercises for the entire cycle.

## Export and Print

In the "Export" section, you can:

1. View the entire program in a print-friendly format
2. Click the "Print" button to print or save as PDF

## Usage Tips

1. **Start with realistic weights** - it's better to start with less weight and successfully complete the entire cycle
2. **Use start percentage** - for example, 70% will allow you to start with 70% of the target weight
3. **Sigmoid progression** works for most cases - it provides a smooth start and finish
4. **Save results regularly** - data is stored locally in your browser
5. **Create different programs** for different goals (strength, mass, endurance)
